How PlainSpeak Works
------------------

PlainSpeak uses a combination of large language models (LLMs) and structured templates to translate natural language into precise computer operations.

See the :doc:`How It Works <guides/how_it_works>` guide for more details.

DataSpeak (Coming Soon)
---------------------

DataSpeak is an upcoming feature that will allow you to query and analyze data using natural language.

See the :doc:`DataSpeak <guides/dataspeak>` guide for more information.
