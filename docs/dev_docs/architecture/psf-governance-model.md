# PlainSpeak PSF Working Group Governance Model

This document outlines the governance model for the proposed PlainSpeak Python Software Foundation Working Group, as referenced in the main PSF proposal.

## 1. Purpose and Mission

The PlainSpeak Working Group exists to:

1. Maintain and evolve the PlainSpeak specification
2. Ensure high-quality implementation of the reference architecture
3. Foster an ecosystem of plugins and extensions
4. Promote natural language interfaces as first-class citizens in the Python ecosystem
5. Ensure accessibility across languages, technical backgrounds, and abilities

## 2. Working Group Structure

### 2.1 Core Team

The Core Team consists of 5-7 members responsible for strategic direction and key decisions:

- **Working Group Chair**: Overall leadership and PSF liaison
- **Specification Lead**: Maintains the formal specification
- **Architecture Lead**: Oversees technical implementation
- **Community Lead**: Manages outreach and contribution pathways
- **Documentation Lead**: Ensures comprehensive documentation
- **Internationalization Lead**: Coordinates language support
- **Security Lead**: Manages security review processes

Initial appointments will be made for staggered terms (1-3 years) with subsequent terms of 2 years, renewable once.

### 2.2 Contributors

Anyone who has made a contribution to PlainSpeak is considered a Contributor. Contributions include:

- Code changes
- Documentation improvements
- Translation work
- Testing and bug reports
- Community support
- Design and user experience feedback

Contributors have no formal term limits and remain as long as they are active in the project.

### 2.3 Plugin Maintainers

Individuals or teams who maintain official plugins or extensions, with responsibilities to:

- Ensure plugin quality and compatibility
- Maintain documentation for their plugins
- Participate in specification discussions that affect plugins
- Adhere to the working group's plugin guidelines

## 3. Decision Making Process

### 3.1 Consensus Model

The working group operates primarily by consensus, defined as general agreement among the Core Team with input from Contributors:

1. **Proposal**: Any Contributor may make a proposal for change
2. **Discussion**: Open discussion period (typically 1-2 weeks)
3. **Refinement**: Proposal may be updated based on feedback
4. **Consensus Check**: Core Team determines if consensus exists
5. **Implementation**: Approved proposals move to implementation

### 3.2 Formal Voting

When consensus cannot be reached, formal voting may be used:

- Each Core Team member gets one vote
- Decisions require a 2/3 majority of voting members
- Abstentions do not count toward the total
- Voting periods last 7 days
- All votes and rationales are publicly recorded

### 3.3 Decision Scope

Different types of decisions have different processes:

| Decision Type | Process | Who Decides |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Specification Changes | RFC + Review + Consensus | Core Team |
| Implementation Decisions | Pull Request + Review | Architecture Lead + Reviewers |
| Working Group Membership | Nomination + Vote | Core Team |
| Process Changes | Proposal + Discussion + Consensus | Core Team |
| Plugin Acceptance | Application + Review | Plugin Lead + 2 Core Team members |

## 4. Membership and Roles

### 4.1 Becoming a Contributor

Anyone who makes a contribution becomes a Contributor. No formal application process is required beyond making the contribution.

### 4.2 Core Team Membership

New Core Team members are selected through:

1. **Nomination**: Self-nomination or nomination by existing Core Team member
2. **Qualification Review**: Assessment of contributions and expertise
3. **Consensus Discussion**: Core Team discusses the nomination
4. **Formal Vote**: 2/3 majority of Core Team required for approval

Core Team members are expected to:
- Actively participate in discussions and decisions
- Attend monthly working group meetings
- Review and contribute to specifications and code
- Mentor and support new Contributors
- Represent the working group in the broader community

### 4.3 Removal and Resignation

Core Team members may resign at any time. Removal may occur for:
- Code of Conduct violations
- Inactivity (6+ months without participation)
- Persistent blocking of group consensus without constructive alternatives

Removal requires a 2/3 vote of the remaining Core Team.

## 5. Communication and Transparency

### 5.1 Public Communications

The working group will maintain:

- Public mailing list for announcements and discussions
- GitHub repository for code, specifications, and issue tracking
- Monthly public meetings with published agendas and minutes
- Quarterly reports to the PSF
- Documentation website with current specifications and guides

### 5.2 Private Communications

Certain discussions may be private, limited to:
- Code of Conduct violations
- Security vulnerabilities (prior to public disclosure)
- Personal matters related to working group membership

All other discussions should be public.

### 5.3 Meetings

- Monthly Core Team meetings (public unless handling private matters)
- Quarterly all-hands meetings for broader community participation
- Special meetings for urgent issues as needed
- Annual in-person meeting at PyCon (when possible)

All public meetings will have:
- Published agendas at least 3 days in advance
- Meeting notes published within 5 days
- Remote participation options

## 6. Relationship with PSF

### 6.1 Oversight

The working group operates under PSF oversight with:
- Annual review by the PSF Board or designee
- Quarterly progress reports
- Adherence to PSF policies and Code of Conduct
- PSF trademark usage according to guidelines

### 6.2 Resources

The working group may request PSF resources including:
- Infrastructure for code hosting, CI/CD, and documentation
- Promotion through PSF channels
- Representation at PyCon and other events
- Fiscal sponsorship for specific initiatives
- Legal support for intellectual property matters

### 6.3 Conflict Resolution

Conflicts within the working group will be addressed through:
1. Internal consensus process
2. Formal voting if consensus fails
3. Mediation by PSF Director if necessary
4. Final resolution by PSF Board in extreme cases

## 7. Code of Conduct

The working group adopts the PSF Code of Conduct in full. Specific responsibilities include:

- Designating at least two Code of Conduct responders
- Establishing clear reporting mechanisms
- Training Core Team members in Code of Conduct enforcement
- Regular review of community interactions
- Commitment to addressing issues promptly and fairly

## 8. Amendments

This governance model may be amended through:

1. Proposal by any Core Team member
2. 14-day public comment period
3. Consensus seeking among Core Team
4. 2/3 majority vote if consensus not reached
5. PSF Board notification of significant changes

## 9. Dissolution

The working group may be dissolved under these conditions:

1. Completion of its mission (as determined by Core Team and PSF)
2. Lack of activity (12+ months without significant progress)
3. Vote by 3/4 of Core Team members
4. Decision by PSF Board

Upon dissolution, all assets and intellectual property will remain with the PSF.

---

This governance model draws inspiration from successful open source projects and PSF working groups while being tailored to the specific needs of the PlainSpeak project. The goal is to create a transparent, inclusive, and effective structure that can sustainably manage the evolution of PlainSpeak as a standard for natural language interfaces in Python.
